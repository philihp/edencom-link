-- item search (/asset/search): given a set of type ids (resolved client-side
-- from a substring match against the SDE), find every current character/corp
-- asset whose type_id is in that set, its root location (station/structure/
-- solar system) and nested-item count. Seeded from just the matched items —
-- not every asset, like character_asset_location_summary()/corp_asset_
-- location_summary() — so this stays cheap even though the caller can pass up
-- to 100 type ids. Both SECURITY INVOKER (the default), so character_asset/
-- corp_asset RLS keeps reads scoped to the caller.
